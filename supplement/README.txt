Notes for BitShares-core:
1. editline is not used in Windows binaries.
2. MinGW and pthreads-win32 are only used for Windows binaries.
3. For source code licensed under the ZLIB license (base64.cpp),
   an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be appreciated
   but is not required (nor the license file).
4. The editline license file is not required in binary distributions.
   The only requirement is "credits must appear in the documentation".
5. The boost license file is not required in binary distributions due to
   the clause "...unless such copies or derivative works are solely in
   the form of machine-executable object code generated by
   a source language processor".
